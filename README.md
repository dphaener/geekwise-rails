# Ruby on Rails

A [Geekwise Academy](http://geekwiseacademy.com/) course taught by Darin Haener.

## Summary

<blockquote>
Rails is a web application development framework written in the Ruby language. It is designed to make programming web
applications easier by making assumptions about what every developer needs to get started. It allows you to write less
code while accomplishing more than many other languages and frameworks. Experienced Rails developers also report that
it makes web application development more fun.

I couldn't have said it better myself - Rails developers really *do* have more fun. In all seriousness, Rails provides
a powerful set of tools that, if leveraged properly, will vastly improve your productivity and make it a joy maintain
your code for years to come.

In this course, you will learn the ins-and-outs of the Rails framework and become a proficient Rubyist along the way.
In class, you will learn by discovery as we build Basewise, a clone of Basecamp. This is not a class for spectators;
you'll be getting your hands dirty with code on day one. You will have the opportunity to apply your new knowledge
often with mini in-class exercises. By the end, you will be able to create a full-functioning Rails application from
the ground up. The [final project](https://github.com/dphaener/geekwise-rails/blob/master/final-project/spec.md) is
your chance to show off your freshly-acquired skills -- I highly encourage you to have fun and be creative with it!

I look forward to embarking on this journey with you!
