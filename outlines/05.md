# Day 5: User Registration

We'll begin developing on the [Day 5](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise/tree/day-5) branch of [Basewise](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone git@github.com:dphaener/basewise.git
    $ cd basewise
    $ git checkout day-5

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd basewise
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-5

## GitHub

We've been forgetting (my fault) to commit our code to GitHub, let's go ahead and
commit last weeks code.

## The Final Project

If you haven't already, please check out the [spec for the final project](https://github.com/dphaener/geekwise-rails/blob/master/final-project/spec.md). Feel free to get started anytime. (Hint: there's quite a bit of overlap between what we've built so far in class and what you need to have in your final project).

## Review

Last week we created the authenticate method with tests. We ended the class with
implementing the has_secure_password method. We ran into problems while creating
the password digest and tests were failing.

## Registration

**Discuss:** What do we need to add to our app to display a registration page? What "resources" are involved?

Let's use some built-in Rails generators to help us.

### Form Helpers

Explore the markup generated by the Rails form helpers and how to bind model data to a form.

Resources:

- [Form Helpers Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html)
- [form_for docs](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionView/Helpers/FormHelper.html#method-i-form_for)

### Routing

Run `rake routes` to see where the form POST will get routed.

### SCSS and CSS Frameworks

We are using Sass for CSS precompliation. Biggest wins:

- Mixins
- Inheritance
- Nesting
- Variables

Resources:

- [Sass Basics](http://sass-lang.com/guide)

### Filtering User Input

Discuss the [strong_parameters](https://github.com/rails/strong_parameters) library and mass assignment vulnerabilites.

**Discuss:** What are the possible scenarios when a user hits the create action? Diagram them, then write some tests.

### Redirection versus Rendering

Discuss the difference between `redirect_to` and `render`.

### Displaying Errors in the Interface

What if the user submits invalid input? We need to display the errors back to the user.

**Exercise:** Recall that validation errors are accessible via the `errors` method. That errors object has a `full_messages` method that returns an `Array` of error message strings. The errors object also has an `any?` method that returns true or false, depending on whether there are any errors.

With this knowledge, list all the current errors at top of the registration form page. If there are no errors, then skip rendering the list. Please use an unordered list.

**Hint:** Make it look nice by using this code from the [Refills](http://refills.bourbon.io/components/#flashes) library.
