# Day 4: User Registration

We'll begin developing on the [Day 4](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise/tree/day-4) branch of [Basewise](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

**Everyone needs to clone my repository today**

    $ rm -rf basewise
    $ git clone git@github.com:dphaener/basewise.git
    $ cd basewise
    $ git checkout day-4
    $ git remote set-url origin <your repositories url here>

## Password Validations

Last time we implemented a `password` virtual attribute. Now we can add validation logic.

**Discuss:** What kind of validations do we need for passwords?

Introduce conditional validations.

## Password Encryption

Rails provides a handy class macro to help us out with encrypting and decrypting the password.

```ruby
has_secure_password
```

[See the API docs](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveModel/SecurePassword/ClassMethods.html) for an in depth description of this method.

### BCrypt

BCrypt is nice encryption library, and is required by has_secure_password. Add to the Gemfile:

    gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '~> 3.1.7'

## Authentication

Implement an `authenticate` class method that will check for a valid email/password combination.

**Discuss:** What do we need to do in this method?

- What inputs does the method need to accept?
- How should we determine if the provided credentials are correct?
- What should we return in each case?

Let's write unit tests, then implement the feature.
