# Day 2: Models

We'll begin developing on the [Day 2](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise/tree/day-2) branch of
[Basewise](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in
your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone git@github.com:dphaener/basewise.git
    $ cd basewise
    $ git checkout day-2

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd basewise
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-2

## Managing External Dependencies

All the external gem dependencies for a Rails application are stored in the Gemfile. The Gemfile is used by [Bundler](http://bundler.io/). Let's take a look at Rails' default dependencies.

Anytime you update the Gemfile, you need to run `bundle install`.

## A Little Test Environment Setup

We need to add a few testing gems to our Gemfile:

```ruby
group :test do
  gem 'shoulda'
  gem 'fabrication'
end
```

And configure Rails to use the fabrication gem instead of plain old fixures. Append to `config/application.rb`:

```ruby
config.app_generators do |g|
  g.test_framework      :test_unit, fixture_replacement: :fabrication
  g.fixture_replacement :fabrication, dir: "test/fabricators"
end
```

These will come into play when we start writing tests.

## The Model Layer

Models are the "M" in "MVC". They are what we use to create, read, update, and delete data in our application. Rails
ships with an object-relational mapper called Active Record. This library allows you perform complex database
operations without writing SQL queries (the language that databases speak). Instead, you can express them in Ruby.

Resources:

- [Active Record Basics](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html)
- [Active record pattern](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Active_record_pattern)
- [ActiveRecord::Base API Docs](http://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActiveRecord/Base.html)

Let's create our first model. Head over to the `app/models` directory and create a `project.rb` file:

    class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
    end

## Using the Rails Console

Remember IRB from earlier? Rails offers a console, which is essentially IRB with all your application code locked
and loaded.

    $ rails console

Or, for short:

    $ rails c

Then try to instantiate a new instance of `Project`. What do you see?

Rails is magical, but not THAT magical - we still have to create our table in the database. Fortunately, Rails has a
built-in system for managing and performing database changes.

## Database Migrations

In the previous example we created the `project.rb` file by hand. Rails comes with a generator that will create that
file for you AND create the database migration file needed to create our table. Let's delete the file we just created
and let the generator do the work for us.

    $ rm app/models/project.rb
    $ rails generate model Project title:string description:text

Let's look at the new file generated in the `db/migrate` directory:

```ruby
class CreateProjects < ActiveRecord::Migration
  def change
    create_table :projects do |t|
      t.string :title
      t.text :description

      t.timestamps
    end
  end
end
```

Observations:

- A `class` that inherits from `ActiveRecord::Migration`. So, Rails knows that this is a database migration.
- A method called `change` -- Rails will execute this method when you tell it to run the migration.
- Inside `change`, there is a method call to `create_table` with the symbol `:projects` and a block.
- Inside the block:
    - `t.string :title` will create a `STRING` column called `title`
    - `t.text :description` will create a `TEXT` column called `description`
    - `t.timestamps` will create the default timestamp columns: `created_at` and `updated_at`
- You're probably wondering: where's the primary key?
    - Active Record automatically creates an auto-incrementing integer `id` column
- The model class is singular (`Project`) and it's table name is plural (`projects`).

This is an example of a Rails DSL (domain-specific language). We aren't privy to what is actually going on internally,
and that's okay. The `create_table` method is an example of the Builder pattern.

There are other similar methods for database modifications -- we will get to those in due time.

Now that our migration is ready to go, we need to run it.

    $ rake db:migrate

## CRUD Operations

### Creating Records

Let's fire up the Rails console and create a new project.

Note: `Project` is a *class* and calling the `new` method creates a new *instance* of `Project` in Ruby. This instance
is not persisted in the database until we explictly save it.

    > project = Project.new
    > project.title = "My Cool Project"
    > project.save
    #=> true

    > project = Project.create(title: "My Cool Project")

If saving fails for any reason, the `#save` method will return false; otherwise, it returns true. Sometimes you want to
raise an exception when persistance fails:

    > project.save!
    > project = Project.create!(title: "My Cool Project")

### Reading Records

It looks like we've just created some records - yay! But how do we really know? Let's read them!

    > Project.count
    > Project.all
    > Project.where(title: "My Cool Project")

Active Record ships with a very powerful query builder. We will continue building up our Active Record fu throughout this course.

### Updating Records

    > project = Project.first
    > project.title = "New Title"
    > project.save

or

    > project.update_attributes(title: "Another new title")

### Deleting Records

    > project = Project.first
    > project.delete

or

    > project.destroy

There is a subtle but important difference between the `#delete` and `#destroy` methods. More on that later.

## Making the Case for Validations

Imagine someone signs up for Basewise and tries to create a project that does not have a title.

**Mini Exercise**: Jump into your console and create a new project with no title.

We need some way to ensure that a project is created with a title. Validations to the rescue!

## Your First Unit Test

Central to the practice of TDD (test-driven development) is the writing unit tests before actually writing the
implementation. Let's write a test for our validation now.

Open up `test/models/project_test.rb` and add a test:

```ruby
should "require the project to have a title" do
  project = Fabricate.build(:project, title: nil)
  assert_not project.valid?
end
```

Run our test suite and watch it fail:

    $ rake

Now, let's make it pass:

```ruby
class Project < ActiveRecord::Base
  validates :title, :presence => true
end
```

Note: The `validates` method is called a **class macro**. Fundamentally, it's just a method defined on the
ActiveRecord::Base class that, when called, will register a validation rule for the model. We'll see many more class
macros moving forward. There are a number of other handy built-in validators as well.

Let's see if our tests pass now.

Further reading:

- [Active Record Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html)

**Exercise**: Validate that the description is present and write an accompanying unit test. Feel free
to check out the guide above for reference.

## Passing Data To The View Layer

Now that we've manually created some projects, let's display them in the user interface.

First, we'll write some tests around our `ProjectsController#index` action:

```ruby
require 'test_helper'

class ProjectsControllerTest < ActionController::TestCase
  context "GET #index" do
    setup do
      get :index
    end

    should respond_with(200)
    should render_template("index")
    should "assign to projects" do
      assert_not_nil assigns(:projects)
    end
  end
end
```

We want to fetch our projects and put them in a variable to be passed along to our template. The way to expose data to
the view layer is through **instance variables** at the controller layer:

```ruby
class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @projects = "All the projects!"
  end
end
```

Now, in our index view we have access to the `@projects` variable:

```html
<%= @projects %>
```

Are your tests passing now?

Fire up your server and hit [http://localhost:3000/projects](http://localhost:3000/projects). What do you see?

- [HTTP Status Code Reference](http://httpstatus.es/)

## Rendering Dynamic Output with ERB

In our previous example, we rendered the contents of the `@projects` variable using `<%=  %>`. This tag outputs the
return value of whatever Ruby code you put in it. The `<%  %>` tag (no equals sign) also evaluates Ruby code, but does
not output the return value.

What we really want to pass in the `@projects` variable is a collection of all projects. Let's make the test a little
more specific:

```ruby
context "GET #index" do
  setup do
    @project = Fabricate(:project)
    get :index
  end

  should respond_with(200)
  should render_template("index")
  should "assign to projects" do
    assert_equal [@project], assigns(:projects).to_a
  end
end
```

Then, let's make it pass.

```ruby
class ProjectsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    @projects = Project.all
  end
end
```

In the view, we need to iterate over each project and display it.

```html
<ol class="projects">
  <% @projects.each do |project| %>
    <li>
      <p><%= project.title %></p>
      <p><%= project.description %></p>
    </li>
  <% end %>
</ol>
```

Refresh the index view. What do you see?

**Exercise:** Display the date/time at which the project was last updated at below the description.

- [Strfime.net](http://strftime.net/) (a handy utility for constructing time formatting strings)

## Sorting Projects

We need to explictly sort by creation time in reverse order to make sure the newest projects appear first.

```ruby
@projects = Project.all.order(created_at: :desc)
```
