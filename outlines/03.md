# Day 3: Validations & Unit Testing

We'll begin developing on the [Day 3](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise/tree/day-3) branch of [Basewise](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone git@github.com:dphaener/basewise.git
    $ cd basewise
    $ git checkout day-3

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd basewise
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-3

## Summary

Let's walk through the app and explore what we have already developed.

* Discuss unit tests and fabricators
* Review routes, controllers, views, and models.

## Creating Users

Up to this point, our data model has consisted of only one database table containing projects. We need to create a table to store user data.

**Exercise:** Generate a `User` model with the following string attributes: `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `password_digest`. Hint: [This guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/command_line.html#rails-generate) on using the `rails generate` command may come in handy.

## Validations

**Discuss:** What validation rules need to be in place?

Before writing validations, let's make sure our user fabricator is in a valid state.

We need to use sequences in our fabricator to prevent uniqueness issues. [Explore the docs](http://www.fabricationgem.org/#!sequences) to learn how.

**Exercise:** Implement validation rules with tests. This may help: [Active Record Validations](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_validations.html).

Feel free to use this regular expression for email addresses:

    /\A[A-Za-z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Za-z0-9.-]+\.[A-Za-z]+\z/

## Non-Column Attributes

Remember, at the end of the day our models are just plain old Ruby objects. Thus we can define our own methods that act like our "column" methods but don't actually map to a column. These are sometimes referred to as "virtual attributes" in the context of Active Record.

Such a column will come in handy for dealing with user passwords (since we want to be able to receive a "password" as input but never want to store it directly in the database):

```ruby
user = User.new
user.password = "pa$$w0rd"

user.digest = " ... " # some new digest
```

The `password_digest` is private. From the outside, we don't care to know how it is generated.

Let's implement a `password` attribute.
