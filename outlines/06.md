# Day 6: Authentication

We'll begin developing on the [Day 6](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise/tree/day-6) branch of [Basewise](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone git@github.com:dphaener/basewise.git
    $ cd basewise
    $ git checkout day-6

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd basewise
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-6

## Testing the Registration Page

You didn't think you'd get off that easy, right?

Last class, we skipped writing tests for the registration page. Let's go back and add them now.

**Discuss:** What do we need to test?

- List out possible scenarios
- Setup each scenario
- Determine what we need to "assert" in each scenario

There's a nice [Rails  guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html#functional-tests-for-your-controllers) for testing.

Some tools we'll be using:

- `assert_redirected_to` for redirection
- `flash[:notice]` to access data stored in the flash object
- `assert_difference` to test database insertion

## Login Form

**Discuss:** Can we treat the user authentication flow as a "resource"? What should we call the controller?

Create the controller using `rails generate controller` and implement a login form, writing tests first.

## Remembering Who Logged In

Rails makes it dead easy to (securely) store data across requests using session cookies. It's as simple as `session[:foo] = "bar"`.

**Discuss:** What do we need to test?

- List out possible scenarios
- Setup each scenario
- Determine what we need to "assert" in each scenario

Some implementation details:

- Extract session logic into `login_as` and `logout` methods
- Create a custom `assert_logged_in_as` method for easier testing
- Log the user in right after registration (test first)
