# Day 11: Nested Resources & Todos

We'll begin developing on the [Day 11](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise/tree/day-11) branch of [Basewise](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dphaener/basewise.git
    $ cd basewise
    $ git checkout day-11

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd basewise
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-11

## Todos

**Discuss:** How should we implement this?

- Model
  What attributes do we need?
  What associations do we need?
- Routes
  What routes do we need to implement
- Which controller?
- Which action?
- Which verb (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE)?
- Views
  How should we display the todo lists?

**Exercise:** Use a rails generator to generate the model and create the proper
associations.

## Creating New Todos

**Discuss:** How should we implement this? What UI and UX concerns do we have?

Pair code to create the create to do lists interface
