## Review of Rails and CoffeeScript

Review the changes I made to make the todo list functional. Talk about how this
javascript will affect the rest of the app, and how to create page specific JS
in Rails.

**Exercise:** Let's extract the todo portion into a partial.

## Review of service objects

Review the service object we created, and discuss any questions anyone has about
how this works, when to do it, and how it makes testing easier.

## Decorators or Presenters

**Discuss:** What is a decorator or presenter, and how can we use them in Rails
to make our code more DRY and OO.

Check out [this](http://johnotander.com/rails/2014/03/07/decorators-on-rails/)
great blog post on how and why to use decorators for more information.

## Final questions and wrap up

**Discuss:** What are any final questions you have about Rails and the work we
have done so far, and what can I make more clear?
