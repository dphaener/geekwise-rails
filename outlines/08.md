# Day 8: Associations

We'll begin developing on the [Day 8](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise/tree/day-8) branch of [Basewise](https://github.com/dphaener/basewise). If you followed along through last class, you can continue on in your own repository.

Or, feel free to `clone` my repository and `checkout` the branch:

    $ git clone https://github.com/dphaener/basewise.git
    $ cd basewise
    $ git checkout day-8

If you already have cloned my repository, `fetch` all changes, then `checkout` the branch:

    $ cd basewise
    $ git fetch origin
    $ git checkout -t origin/day-8

## Associating Projects with Users

We need to setup a one-to-many relationship between users and projects. Let's generate a Rails migration for this and then wire up the ActiveRecord associations.

At this point, it's probably best to nuke our development database: `rake db:reset`.

## New Project Form

It's easy to create associated objects:

    user.projects.create(project_params)

Explore in the Rails console.

**Exercise:** Build a form for creating new projects.

Then, create a link on the index page where the placeholder currently is.

## Project Pages

**Discuss:** How should we implement this?

- Which controller?
- Which action?
- Which verb (GET, POST, PUT/PATCH, DELETE)?
